Hello! Yiğit here, this is my small static website, hosted at Github pages. I'm an Earth Observation Data Services Engineer at EUMETSAT via Innoflair. I'm interested in data visualization and anything geospatial. I also prepare lots of graphs and do analysis for a citizen science project called "Nachtlicht-BüHNE". I'll try to populate this page as my career goes.

### Research Interests
* Remote sensing
* Geospatial data analysis
* Cloud computing
* Light pollution
* Tectonic geodesy
