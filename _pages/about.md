Hello! Yiğit here, this is my small static website hosted at Github pages. I'm a MSc student (graduating in March 2022), interested in surface deformation and geographical data analysis. I also do lots of visualizing/analysis for a citizen science project called "Nachtlicht-BüHNE". I'll try to populate this page as my career goes.

### Research Interests
* Remote Sensing
* Geospatial Data Analysis
* Surface Deformation
* InSAR Time-Series
* Light pollution
