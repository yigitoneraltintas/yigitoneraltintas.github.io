Hello! YiÄŸit here, this is my small static website, hosted at Github pages. I'm an Earth Observation Data Services Engineer at EUMETSAT via Innoflair. I'm interested in geospatial data and cloud native computing. I also prepare lots of graphs and do analysis for different citizen science projects about light pollution. I'll try to populate this page as my career goes.

### Research Interests
* Remote sensing
* Geospatial data analysis
* Cloud computing
* Light pollution
* Tectonic geodesy
