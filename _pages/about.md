Hello! Yiğit here, this is my small static website hosted at Github pages. I'm a recent remote sensing master's graduate, interested in measuring surface deformation and geographical data analysis. I also do lots of visualizing/analysis for a citizen science project called "Nachtlicht-BüHNE". I'll try to populate this page as my career goes.

### Research Interests
* Remote sensing
* Geospatial data analysis
* Surface deformation
* Tectonic geodesy
* Light pollution
