Hello! Yiğit here, this is my small static website, hosted at Github pages. I'm a recent remote sensing Master's graduate, interested in anything geospatial, measuring surface deformation from space and data visualization. I also prepare lots of graphs and do analysis for a citizen science project "Nachtlicht-BüHNE". I'll try to populate this page as my career goes.

### Research Interests
* Remote sensing
* Geospatial data analysis
* Surface deformation
* Tectonic geodesy
* Light pollution
