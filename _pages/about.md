Hello! Yigit here, this is my small static website that I'm hosting at Github pages. I'm MSc student (soon to be graduating), doing mostly remote sensing and geoinformation. I'll try to populate this page as my career goes.

### Research Interests
* Earth observation data analysis
* Remote sensing
* Global tectonics
* Surface deformation
* InSAR time-series
* Light pollution
