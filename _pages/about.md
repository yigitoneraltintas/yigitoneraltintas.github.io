Hello! YiÄŸit here, and this is my small static website hosted on GitHub Pages. I work as an Earth Observation Data Services Engineer at EUMETSAT through Innoflair. My interests include geospatial data and cloud-native computing. I also create numerous graphs and conduct analyses for various citizen science projects related to light pollution. I'll continue to update this page as my career progresses.
