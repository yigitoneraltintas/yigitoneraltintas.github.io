## Education
* MSc in Remote Sensing, geoInformation and Visualization (RSIV), University of Potsdam, 04.2022
  * Thesis: "Measuring high-resolution surface deformation signals in Turkey using Sentinel-1 radar interferometry". On my thesis, I've been mostly working with open-source active radar data to extract SAR interferometry information to detect high-resolution (spatial + temporal) surface deformation changing in time.
