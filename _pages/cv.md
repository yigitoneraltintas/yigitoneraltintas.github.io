Education
======
* MSc in Remote Sensing, University of Potsdam, 03.2022
  * Thesis: "Measuring high-resolution surface deformation signals in Turkey using Sentinel-1 radar interferometry". For my thesis, I've been mostly working with open-source active radar data to extract SAR interferometry information to detect high-resolution (spatial + temporal) surface deformation changing in time.
  * Supervisors: Dr. Jonathan R. Weiss and Prof. Bodo Bookhagen
* BSc in Geological Engineering, Ankara University, 02.2019


Professional experience
======
* 09.2020 - 03.2022: Research Assistant at Section 1.4 Remote Sensing, GFZ-Potsdam, Germany [Part-Time]
  * Contributed as a team member to multi-national citizen science project called "Nachtlicht-Bühne", especially on numerical analysis, icon design and GIS work.
  * Created numerous Python scripts for night light data.
  * Designed a conference handbook (Artificial Light at Night (ALAN)) and processed feedbacks for more than 100 abstracts.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Christopher Kyba

* Summer 2018: Erasmus + Intern at Institute Of Geosciences, University Of Graz, Austria [Full-Time]
  * Developed theoretical knowledge for remote sensing as a subject with strong interest on radar remote sensing.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Kurt Stüwe
