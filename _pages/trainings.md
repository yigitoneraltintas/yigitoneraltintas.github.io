Here are a couple of training recordings that I contributed to.:  

### ECMWF Data Access Serices
1. **Introduction to ECMWF Production Data Store (ECPDS):**  
This webinar focuses on ECMWF's Production Data Store (ECPDS), which enables users to receive and manage real-time forecast data through various transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP, etc.). It also allows users to monitor and control data transmissions, including pausing, restarting, and re-queuing transfers. With requirements set in PREd, ECPDS generates and disseminates the requested data to your destination.
